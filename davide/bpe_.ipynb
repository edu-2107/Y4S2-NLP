    "Byte Pair Encoding is a well-known tokenization algorithm that proceeds by making merges of the most frequent adjacent token pairs. It starts with a vocabulary including every single character (in our case, we will use UTF-8 encoding), and then adds new tokens to the vocabulary by merging adjacent ones, as found in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will implement the Byte Pair Encoding algorithm based on three main functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def train(text, vocab_size, verbose=False)`: the function where you will train the BPE tokenizer on some data, and that will give us as an output the *merges* that were made and the trained *vocabulary*.\n",
    "- `def encode(text)`: the function that, given some text, tokenizes it based on the merges obtained from the training step of the tokenizer.\n",
    "- `def decode(ids)`: the function that, given some sequence of tokens, reconstructs the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that GPT tokenizers, such as GPT-4's, includes additional complexity than what is covered in this notebook, including:\n",
    "> - Splitting the text into chunks using a regex pattern before tokenization, meant to ensure that no merges will happen across category boundaries (letters, numbers, punctuation).\n",
    "> - Including special tokens that are not part of the text and are specific to the functioning of the language model."
