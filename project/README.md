### This project aims to use machine learning to categorize consumer complaints based on textual entries

Dataset used: [Consumer Complaints](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/namigabbasov/consumer-complaint-dataset)

To run this project, install the pip libraries in `requirements.txt`, download the dataset to the root directory of the project with the name `complaints.csv`, and then run the different notebooks to see the results! Note: you should run the `preprocessing` notebook before running `train_and_test`.
